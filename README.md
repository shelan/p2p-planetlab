# p2p-planetlab

This project will scrape Planet Lab website and filter out active nodes.

Then it will add active nodes to your slice in the account. After addition it will check for all the nodes and any of the faulty nodes will
be notified and blacklisted.

Further it will run scripts to automate provisioning of software needed for P2P software. (JVM etc)
